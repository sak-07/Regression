**Features of Logistic Regression:**
**Binary Classification:** When trying to predict one of two outcomes in a binary classification problem, logistic regression is specifically used.
**Linear Modeling:** Logistic Regression uses a linear combination of the predictor variables to model the connection between the predictor variables and the binary outcome.
**Logistic Function: **Using a logistic function, the linear combination of predictor variables is converted into a probability score between 0 and 1, which indicates the likelihood that the class is positive.
**Maximum Likelihood Estimation: **This method determines the values of the coefficients that maximize the likelihood of the observed data given the model for the logistic regression model’s coefficients.
Interpretability: Logistic regression offers a simple and understandable model, where the model’s coefficients stand in for each predictor variable’s influence on the binary outcome.
Computationally Efficient: Logistic Regression is computationally effective, making it appropriate for use with big datasets.
Robust to Outliers: Logistic regression is comparatively resilient against outliers, which means that a few outlier values in the predictor variables do not have a big impact on the model.
Feature Scaling: For optimal performance, feature scaling—in which the predictor variables are modified to have comparable scales—is necessary for logistic regression.
Limitations: There are several restrictions associated with the use of logistic regression, including the assumption of linear connections between the predictor variables and the binary outcome as well as the incapability to model intricate interrelationships and interactions between variables.
Now let’s see an example implementation of logistic regression using the Iris dataset:
